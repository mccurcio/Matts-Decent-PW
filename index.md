## Welcome to Decent-Password Page

This Python Jupyter notebook/function generates a 3 word password with a number and special character.

It uses the [What3words](https://what3words.com) API that can provide either: 

1. genereates a three word name for any point on the globe given a latitiude, and longitude as inputs 
2. genereates the latitiude, and longitude given a three word address

What3words has a free tier API where you can sign up.

Using their API, I made a simple function to return *'decent'* random passwords with

a number and special character woven into the 3 word location by default.
