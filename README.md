# Matts-Decent-PW
This Python function generates a 3 word password with a number and special character.

What3words (https://what3words.com) is site that either:

1. genereates a three word name for any point on the globe (I don't know how, yet)
2. genereates the latitiude, and longitude given a three word address (it does slightly more)

What3words has a free tier API where you can sign up.

Using their API, I made a simple function to return decent random passwords with 

a number and special character woven into the 3 word location by default.

Kinda funny, huh?
